        <h2>Kennel cleaning products</h2>
        <img src="kennel-cleaner.webp">
        <p>A dog’s kennel requires regular cleaning and disinfecting, lest bacteria and germs that lead to infections may turn up uninvited. Clean up the fecal matter, hair, dirt, and vomit stains that are also the root cause of foul smell. Using a good disinfectant meant for kennels must follow the cleaning procedure as it will help in eliminating bacteria and other infective agents. If you don’t want your house to have a distinct ‘not so pleasant smell’ emanating from your dog’s coat or piss, then an odor neutralizer/eliminator is your best bet. Also it can be used to house break the pet and sprayed on a carpet/furniture item that he previously soiled to prevent it from depositing a scent mark in the future. A dog’s deodorizer spray comes handy when a dog especially with thicker hair has a perennial and typical foul smell. This simple remedy attacks the stink instantly</p>
